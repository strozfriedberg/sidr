    SIDR: Search Index Database Reporter parses the Windows.edb (In Windows 10) or Windows.db (In Windows 11) database files, which store the data enumerated by Windows Search Indexer service on the Windows endpoint operating systems.
    
    Functionality: SIDR generates three CSV/JSON reports consisting of User Activity, Files and Folders Existence, and Internet History. Generated reports can be uploaded to the Velociraptor Server.
    
    For more information on Windows Search Index see https://www.aon.com/cyber-solutions/aon_cyber_labs/windows-search-index-the-forensic-artifact-youve-been-searching-for/
    
    PSA: If the database size is more than 2GB or the free space in the C drive is less than 5 times the size of the database, then the database will not be parsed. Collecting the database from the endpoint and parsing it on a forensic tower is suggested in that case.
    
    WARNING: In order to parse the database on the target endpoint, SIDR plugin must create an empty database and copy the original database to it. Creating the new copy can result in multiple gigabytes of data in unallocated clusters being overwritten. This may result in a loss of relevant evidence for an in-depth forensic analysis. Please use the plugin with caution, where the likelihood of needing forensic analysis of unallocated clusters is low relative to the benefit of using SIDR via Velociraptor.
